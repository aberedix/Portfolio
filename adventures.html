                        <h2>Rome, Italy</h2>
                        <p> Italy was a different experience by far from all my other trips I have been to and the most fun I had. Italy was very warm welcoming for all travelers that want to come, and it was amazing, just had a feeling like I was at home. Drinking aged wine was a different taste I never had before where the wine yard was at least 5 miles away from the restaurant I had the wine, also having the food so fresh with pasta was a whole different level of cuisine. Being at the Trevi Fountain was amazing because it was attached to hotel that have been there for years and the architect on it is still intact. Being next to the Colosseum where warriors battle to the death and being inside of it and seeing the architect outside of it was amazing experience to be there.</p>

                        <h2>Amsterdam, Netherlands</h2>
                        <p> Amsterdam was one of my very first trips outside the United States ever and it would have a place in my heart as one of my best ones. Amsterdam and the history behind it is super amazing to where how the 13 colonies were built in the United States. The city is like New York but peaceful and they are mostly known for being the bike central of the world. They have many guides for any traveler that want to know anything like the windmills or the history of Amsterdam in general. You can walk around central station experience the kindness and being welcome as a great visitor of the city, it is like the original New York city with stores being in buildings where people also stay on top of them in area, restaurants are open until 3 o'clock in the morning, it is like not leaving America at all.</p>

                        <h2>San Juan, Puerto Rico</h2>
                        <p>Puerto Rico was quite an exciting place to go in the middle of winter. Having the sun and warm weather is a perfect way to enjoy your vacation. Going to many restaurants and eating all type of meals being presented to my disposal was amazing, from eating fish, flans, plantains, beans, and rice had my taste buds going crazy and craving for more. The name of the restaurants I recommend is called Sophia's, where the chicken and the red snapper is amazing with the mixed veggies, and to those who like steaks, their steaks are aged for months before serving to the people. The beaches were so peaceful and calm, the two beaches I went to were called Conado beach and Isla Verde beach and anyone could have been at the beach all day if they could. The waves were calm also, being in the Atlantic Ocean for the first time was so relaxing, it was like being on a cloud. If you are with the family, Isla Verde is the beach that is family oriented and amazing with jet skis and many more activities; but if you just want the sun and the beach to yourself and hardly be bother by anyone, that is when Conado beach comes in. Can get a great tan out there and it is also quiet so you would not be bother by locals or anyone else</p>
